# Environmental-Monitoring-Pollution-Control-projet

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **real-time monitoring of environmental parameters** such as air quality, temperature, humidity, and noise.  
The collected data will be uploaded to a **cloud platform (ThingSpeak/Firebase)** and visualized on a dashboard.


## Improvisations Done (Week 1)
- Defined the **problem statement** and objectives.  
- Selected IoT sensors (Air Quality MQ-135 + DHT11 Temperature & Humidity).  
- Set up Arduino IDE and ESP32 board for data collection.  
- Planned cloud data storage integration.  
- Created GitHub repository for version control.  


## Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware:** ESP32 / Arduino UNO, MQ-135, DHT11  
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python, ThingSpeak/Firebase  
- **Languages:** C++ (Arduino), Python  


## Next Steps (Week 2)
- Implement real-time data transmission to cloud (ThingSpeak).  
- Create a dashboard for visualization.  
- Add noise monitoring sensor integration.
